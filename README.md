# React + Redux + Zustand

This project is a video lessons player made in **React.js**. The purpose of this application was to practice some **state management** concepts using **Redux** and then migrating to **Zustand**, as a more current alternative to Redux. In addition, **unit tests** were created using the **Vitest** library to test all functions of the video player store.

## Instructions

In the [**main**](https://github.com/luismda/react-redux-zustand/tree/main) branch you can find the code that uses Redux for state management. On the [**zustand**](https://github.com/luismda/react-redux-zustand/tree/zustand) branch you can find the version that uses Zustand.

First, clone the project's repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/luismda/react-redux-zustand.git
```

After that, install the dependencies using the command:

```sh
yarn install
```

To run the unit tests run the command:

```sh
yarn test
```

This app uses JSON Server to simulate a REST API. So run the command to start the server:

```sh
yarn server
```

Finally, run the application:

```sh
yarn dev
```
